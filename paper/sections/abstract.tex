	In practice, incomplete data are very common and can lead to failing machine learning pipelines and negatively impact model performance. Although several methods are introduced to impute missing values, it does not exist a comprehensive benchmark that broadly compares them. Therefore, we use representatives for each category of imputation methods (mean/mode, $k$-NN, random forest, NN, GAIN, and VAE) and compare their imputation and impact on downstream performance. For this, we use  $69$ numerical datasets, MCAR, MAR, and MNAR missingness pattern, varying amount of missing values (1\% to 50\%), and repeat the experiments for fully observed and incomplete data to simulate real-world applications.
	The main contributions are (1) comprehensive comparison of available imputation categories and (2) extensive analysis of imputation methods and their performance in given settings.
