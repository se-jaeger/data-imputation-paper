Experiments:
- 70 datasets
- 6 Imputers
- MCAR, MAR, MNAR
- 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5
- missing values in all columns
- random target column
- 5 repetitions

2 Experiments:
- train on fully observed data
- train on already corrupted data
	- To fit the imputer we fill missing vlaues with the mean/mode to get the pipeline running.
