We achieve this by tracking the lineage of produced artifacts and automatically extracting metadata such as hyperparameters of models, schemas of datasets or layouts of deep neural networks.

@techreport{Abedjan2016,
	abstract = {Data cleaning has played a critical role in ensuring data quality for enterprise applications. Naturally, there has been extensive research in this area, and many data cleaning algorithms have been translated into tools to detect and to possibly repair certain classes of errors such as outliers, duplicates, missing values, and violations of integrity constraints. Since different types of errors may coexist in the same data set, we often need to run more than one kind of tool. In this paper, we investigate two pragmatic questions: (1) are these tools robust enough to capture most errors in real-world data sets? and (2) what is the best strategy to holistically run multiple tools to optimize the detection effort? To answer these two questions, we obtained multiple data cleaning tools that utilize a variety of error detection techniques. We also collected five real-world data sets, for which we could obtain both the raw data and the ground truth on existing errors. In this paper, we report our experimental findings on the errors detected by the tools we tested. First, we show that the coverage of each tool is well below 100{\%}. Second, we show that the order in which multiple tools are run makes a big difference. Hence, we propose a holistic multi-tool strategy that orders the invocations of the available tools to maximize their benefit, while minimizing human effort in verifying results. Third, since this holistic approach still does not lead to acceptable error coverage, we discuss two simple strategies that have the potential to improve the situation, namely domain specific tools and data enrichment. We close this paper by reasoning about the errors that are not detectable by any of the tools we tested.},

@inproceedings{Bender2021,
	abstract = {The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

@article{Schelter2018,
	abstract = {Modern companies and institutions rely on data to guide every single business process and decision. Missing or incorrect information seriously compromises any decision process downstream. Therefore, a crucial, but tedious task for everyone involved in data processing is to verify the quality of their data. We present a system for automating the verification of data quality at scale, which meets the requirements of production use cases. Our system provides a declarative API, which combines common quality constraints with userde fined validation code, and thereby enables 'unit tests' for data. We efficiently execute the resulting constraint validation workload by translating it to aggregation queries on Apache Spark. Our platform supports the incremental validation of data quality on growing datasets, and leverages machine learning, e.g., for enhancing constraint suggestions, for estimating the 'predictability' of a column, and for detecting anomalies in historic data quality time series. We discuss our design decisions, describe the resulting system architecture, and present an experimental evaluation on various datasets.},

The platform comprises of a complex end-to-end machine learning system built on Apache Spark, which includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, distributed learning, as well as evaluation, experimentation and ensembling. Furthermore, it meets the demands of a production system and scales to large catalogues containing millions of items. We describe the challenges of building such a platform and discuss our design decisions. We detail aspects on several levels of the system, such as a set of general distributed learning schemes, our machinery for ensembling predictions, and a high-level data ow abstraction for modeling complex ML pipelines. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of prior work on real-world demand forecasting systems which rivals our approach in terms of scalability.},

@article{Stoyanovich2020,
	abstract = {The need for responsible data management intensifies with the growing impact of data on society. One central locus of the societal impact of data are Automated Decision Systems (ADS), socio-legal-technical systems that are used broadly in industry, non-profits, and government. ADS process data about people, help make decisions that are consequential to people's lives, are designed with the stated goals of improving efficiency and promoting equitable access to opportunity, involve a combination of human and automated decision making, and are subject to auditing for legal compliance and to public disclosure. They may or may not use AI, and may or may not operate with a high degree of autonomy, but they rely heavily on data.In this article, we argue that the data management community is uniquely positioned to lead the responsible design, development, use, and oversight of ADS. We outline a technical research agenda that requires that we step outside our comfort zone of engineering for efficiency and accuracy, to also incorporate reasoning about values and beliefs. This seems high-risk, but one of the upsides is being able to explain to our children what we do and why it matters.},

	abstract = {Data profiling comprises a broad range of methods to ef-ficiently analyze a given data set. In a typical scenario, which mirrors the capabilities of commercial data pro-filing tools, tables of a relational database are scanned to derive metadata, such as data types and value pat-terns, completeness and uniqueness of columns, keys and foreign keys, and occasionally functional dependen-cies and association rules. Individual research projects have proposed several additional profiling tasks, such as the discovery of inclusion dependencies or conditional functional dependencies. Data profiling deserves a fresh look for two reasons: First, the area itself is neither established nor defined in any principled way, despite significant research activity on individual parts in the past. Second, more and more data beyond the traditional relational databases are be-ing created and beg to be profiled. The article proposes new research directions and challenges, including inter-active and incremental profiling and profiling heteroge-neous and non-relational data.},

	abstract = {Machine learning is a powerful tool for gleaning knowledge from massive amounts of data. While a great deal of machine learning research has focused on improving the accuracy and efficiency of training and inference algorithms, there is less attention in the equally important problem of monitoring the quality of data fed to machine learning. The importance of this problem is hard to dispute: errors in the input data can nullify any benefits on speed and accuracy for training and inference. This argument points to a data-centric approach to machine learning that treats training and serving data as an important production asset, on par with the algorithm and infrastructure used for learning. In this paper, we tackle this problem and present a data validation system that is designed to detect anomalies specifically in data fed into machine learning pipelines. This system is deployed in production as an integral part of TFX(Baylor et al., 2017)-an end-to-end machine learning platform at Google. It is used by hundreds of product teams use it to continuously monitor and validate several petabytes of production data per day. We faced several challenges in developing our system, most notably around the ability of ML pipelines to soldier on in the face of unexpected patterns, schema-free data, or training/serving skew. We discuss these challenges, the techniques we used to address them, and the various design choices that we made in implementing the system. Finally, we present evidence from the system's deployment in production that illustrate the tangible benefits of data validation in the context of ML: early detection of errors, model-quality wins from using better data, savings in engineering hours to debug problems, and a shift towards data-centric workflows in model development.},

	abstract = {Creating and maintaining a platform for reliably producing and deploying machine learning models requires careful orchestration of many components - a learner for generating models based on training data, modules for analyzing and validating both data as well as models, and finally infrastructure for serving models in production. This becomes particularly challenging when data changes over time and fresh models need to be produced continuously. Unfortunately, such orchestration is often done ad hoc using glue code and custom scripts developed by individual teams for specific use cases, leading to duplicated effort and fragile systems with high technical debt. We present TensorFlow Extended (TFX), a TensorFlow-based general-purpose machine learning platform implemented at Google. By integrating the aforementioned components into one platform, we were able to standardize the components, simplify the platform configuration, and reduce the time to production from the order of months to weeks, while providing platform stability that minimizes disruptions. We present the case study of one deployment of TFX in the Google Play app store, where the machine learning models are refreshed continuously as new data arrive. Deploying TFX led to reduced custom code, faster experiment cycles, and a 2{\%} increase in app installs resulting from improved data and model analysis.},

We show that data augmentation (a form of weak supervision) is key to training high-quality, ML-based error detection models that require minimal human involvement. Our framework consists of two parts: (1) an expressive model to learn rich representations that capture the inherent syntactic and semantic heterogeneity of errors; and (2) a data augmentation model that, given a small seed of clean records, uses dataset-specific transformations to automatically generate additional training data. Our key insight is to learn data augmentation policies from the noisy input dataset in a weakly supervised manner. We show that our framework detects errors with an average precision of {\~{}}94{\%} and an average recall of {\~{}}93{\%} across a diverse array of datasets that exhibit different types and amounts of errors. We compare our approach to a comprehensive collection of error detection methods, ranging from traditional rule-based methods to ensemble-based and active learning approaches. We show that data augmentation yields an average improvement of 20 F1 points while it requires access to 3√ó fewer labeled examples compared to other ML approaches.},

Inspired by recent theoretical advances in probabilistic inference, we introduce a series of optimizations which ensure that inference over HoloClean's probabilistic model scales to instances with millions of tuples. We show that HoloClean scales to instances with millions of tuples and find data repairs with an average precision of ‚àº 90{\%} and an average recall of above ‚àº 76{\%} across a diverse array of datasets exhibiting different types of errors.

	abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) models are difficult to maintain in production settings. In particular, deviations of the unseen serving data (for which we want to compute predictions) from the source data (on which the model was trained) pose a central challenge, especially when model training and prediction are outsourced via cloud services. Errors or shifts in the serving data can affect the predictive quality of a model, but are hard to detect for engineers operating ML deployments.We propose a simple approach to automate the validation of deployed ML models by estimating the model's predictive performance on unseen, unlabeled serving data. In contrast to existing work, we do not require explicit distributional assumptions on the dataset shift between the source and serving data. Instead, we rely on a programmatic specification of typical cases of dataset shift and data errors. We use this information to learn a performance predictor for a pretrained black box model that automatically raises alarms when it detects performance drops on unseen serving data.We experimentally evaluate our approach on various datasets, models and error types. We find that it reliably predicts the performance of black box models in the majority of cases, and outperforms several baselines even in the presence of unspecified data errors.},

	abstract = {The success of applications that process data critically depends on the quality of the ingested data. Completeness of a data source is essential in many cases. Yet, most missing value imputation approaches suffer from severe limitations. They are almost exclusively restricted to numerical data, and they either offer only simple imputation methods or are difficult to scale and maintain in production. Here we present a robust and scalable approach to imputation that extends to tables with non-numerical values, including unstructured text data in diverse languages. Experiments on public data sets as well as data sets sampled from a large product catalog in different languages (English and Japanese) demonstrate that the proposed approach is both scalable and yields more accurate imputations than previous approaches. Training on data sets with several million rows is a matter of minutes on a single machine. With a median imputation F1 score of 0.93 across a broad selection of data sets our approach achieves on average a 23-fold improvement compared to mode imputation. While our system allows users to apply state-of-the-art deep learning models if needed, we find that often simple linear n-gram models perform on par with deep learning methods at a much lower operational cost. The proposed method learns all parameters of the entire imputation pipeline automatically in an end-to-end fashion, rendering it attractive as a generic plugin both for engineers in charge of data pipelines where data completeness is relevant, as well as for practitioners without expertise in machine learning who need to impute missing values in tables with non-numerical data.},

@article{VAE_for_genomic_data,
	abstract = {{As missing values are frequently present in genomic data, practical methods to handle missing data are necessary for downstream analyses that require complete data sets. State-of-the-art imputation techniques, including methods based on singular value decomposition and K-nearest neighbors, can be computationally expensive for large data sets and it is difficult to modify these algorithms to handle certain cases not missing at random.In this work, we use a deep-learning framework based on the variational auto-encoder (VAE) for genomic missing value imputation and demonstrate its effectiveness in transcriptome and methylome data analysis. We show that in the vast majority of our testing scenarios, VAE achieves similar or better performances than the most widely used imputation standards, while having a computational advantage at evaluation time. When dealing with data missing not at random (e.g., few values are missing), we develop simple yet effective methodologies to leverage the prior knowledge about missing data. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of varying latent space regularization strength in VAE on the imputation performances and, in this context, show why VAE has a better imputation capacity compared to a regular deterministic auto-encoder.We describe a deep learning imputation framework for transcriptome and methylome data using a VAE and show that it can be a preferable alternative to traditional methods for data imputation, especially in the setting of large-scale data and certain missing-not-at-random scenarios.}},
