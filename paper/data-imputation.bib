	abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) models are difficult to maintain in production settings. In particular, deviations of the unseen serving data (for which we want to compute predictions) from the source data (on which the model was trained) pose a central challenge, especially when model training and prediction are outsourced via cloud services. Errors or shifts in the serving data can affect the predictive quality of a model, but are hard to detect for engineers operating ML deployments.We propose a simple approach to automate the validation of deployed ML models by estimating the model's predictive performance on unseen, unlabeled serving data. In contrast to existing work, we do not require explicit distributional assumptions on the dataset shift between the source and serving data. Instead, we rely on a programmatic specification of typical cases of dataset shift and data errors. We use this information to learn a performance predictor for a pretrained black box model that automatically raises alarms when it detects performance drops on unseen serving data.We experimentally evaluate our approach on various datasets, models and error types. We find that it reliably predicts the performance of black box models in the majority of cases, and outperforms several baselines even in the presence of unspecified data errors.},

@inproceedings{Biessmann2018a,
	abstract = {The success of applications that process data critically depends on the quality of the ingested data. Completeness of a data source is essential in many cases. Yet, most missing value imputation approaches suffer from severe limitations. They are almost exclusively restricted to numerical data, and they either offer only simple imputation methods or are difficult to scale and maintain in production. Here we present a robust and scalable approach to imputation that extends to tables with non-numerical values, including unstructured text data in diverse languages. Experiments on public data sets as well as data sets sampled from a large product catalog in different languages (English and Japanese) demonstrate that the proposed approach is both scalable and yields more accurate imputations than previous approaches. Training on data sets with several million rows is a matter of minutes on a single machine. With a median imputation F1 score of 0.93 across a broad selection of data sets our approach achieves on average a 23-fold improvement compared to mode imputation. While our system allows users to apply state-of-the-art deep learning models if needed, we find that often simple linear n-gram models perform on par with deep learning methods at a much lower operational cost. The proposed method learns all parameters of the entire imputation pipeline automatically in an end-to-end fashion, rendering it attractive as a generic plugin both for engineers in charge of data pipelines where data completeness is relevant, as well as for practitioners without expertise in machine learning who need to impute missing values in tables with non-numerical data.},

	abstract = "{As missing values are frequently present in genomic data, practical methods to handle missing data are necessary for downstream analyses that require complete data sets. State-of-the-art imputation techniques, including methods based on singular value decomposition and K-nearest neighbors, can be computationally expensive for large data sets and it is difficult to modify these algorithms to handle certain cases not missing at random.In this work, we use a deep-learning framework based on the variational auto-encoder (VAE) for genomic missing value imputation and demonstrate its effectiveness in transcriptome and methylome data analysis. We show that in the vast majority of our testing scenarios, VAE achieves similar or better performances than the most widely used imputation standards, while having a computational advantage at evaluation time. When dealing with data missing not at random (e.g., few values are missing), we develop simple yet effective methodologies to leverage the prior knowledge about missing data. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of varying latent space regularization strength in VAE on the imputation performances and, in this context, show why VAE has a better imputation capacity compared to a regular deterministic auto-encoder.We describe a deep learning imputation framework for transcriptome and methylome data using a VAE and show that it can be a preferable alternative to traditional methods for data imputation, especially in the setting of large-scale data and certain missing-not-at-random scenarios.}",\n
